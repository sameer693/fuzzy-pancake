# Political speech analysis

### Political Speech Analysis with SpaCy Library:
The project on political speech analysis using the SpaCy library focuses on extracting valuable insights from political speeches by leveraging natural language processing techniques. By utilizing the powerful features of the SpaCy library, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of political discourse, sentiment analysis, and key thematic analysis within political speeches.

### The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

#### Data Collection and Preparation:
* The project starts with collecting a diverse range of political speeches as a early start focuses on a dataset of nearly all Twitter messages from Donald J. Trump - All Trump Tweets taken from kaggle. The collected data is then preprocessed to remove noise, including punctuation, stop words, and special characters, while also tokenizing the text into smaller meaningful units.


####  Named Entity Recognition (NER): 
* SpaCy's NER capabilities play a crucial role in identifying and categorizing named entities within the speeches. By utilizing pre-trained models or training custom models, the project aims to extract important information such as the names of politicians, organizations, locations, dates, and other relevant entities mentioned in the speeches. This helps in understanding the context and key actors involved in political events.


#### Sentiment Analysis:
* Political speeches often contain expressions of emotions, opinions, and sentiment. The project utilizes SpaCy's sentiment analysis capabilities to determine the sentiment associated with specific sections or entire speeches. By analyzing the sentiment, the project can gain insights into the overall emotional tone conveyed by politicians and identify positive or negative sentiments related to specific topics or issues.

#### Thematic Analysis: 
* Understanding the main themes and topics discussed in political speeches is vital for extracting meaningful information. By employing SpaCy's part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing features, this project aims to identify the key themes, subjects, and concepts present in the speeches. This analysis helps in uncovering the prominent issues addressed by politicians and enables comparison and tracking of political narratives over time.


#### Visualization and Reporting: 
* To facilitate a clear understanding of the results, the project incorporates data visualization techniques. Using libraries such as Matplotlib or Plotly, the project generates visualizations such as word clouds, sentiment distributions, and topic modeling graphs. Additionally, comprehensive reports and summaries are generated, highlighting the key findings and insights obtained from the political speech analysis.

By combining the power of the SpaCy library's natural language processing capabilities with political speech analysis, this project aims to provide researchers, policymakers, and the general public with valuable insights into political discourse. The analysis of sentiment, named entities, and thematic patterns within political speeches can enhance understanding, promote transparency, and facilitate informed decision-making in the political landscape.
